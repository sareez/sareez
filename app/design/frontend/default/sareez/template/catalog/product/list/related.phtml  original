		<b>How this Replacement policy terms work</b><br>
        With our motto \91complete shopping satisfaction\92, we are dedicated to deliver you the  
        quality products and services. However, it is rarely found that due to some unexpected 
        situation, you are not satisfied with the product, then the following Replacement and 
        Refund Policy Terms apply for a mutually consented resolution. <br>
        <br>
        <b>How this Replacement policy terms work</b> <br>
        If you receive an item in damaged condition or somehow if the item you received was not 
        the item you ordered, then please do contact us as soon as you receive the item in question. 
        We promise that we will offer you the best possible solution. <br>
        <br>
        It is advised not to return the item without informing us. It is very vital that you 
        do not send back the item until you have verified with us. In such a situation, no credit 
        or replacement shall be given. <br>
        <br>
        If we are unable to deliver the original ordered item due to unavoidable reasons, then 
        according to our terms we will request you to select an alternate item and express ship 
        the same to you with no extra shipping cost. Well, if no alternate selection is desired 
        by a customer, then the company will refund you in full with no deduction whatsoever. <br>
        <br>
        Any shipping costs of sending back to India above what customer paid for shipping 
        charges while receiving them from India are the responsibility of the customer. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Helpful Guidelines on Return</b> <br>
        Always report your problems associated with the item, order, packaging etc right on time. 
        You must be as specific as possible at the time of filing your complain. <br>
        <br>
        Always try to return your item using registered airmail or courier service to provide 
        proof of delivery. If something happens in the transit and if the item is not delivered
        to us, it is impossible to help you. So make sure to rely upon reliable courier agency. <br>
        <br>
        Please return the item within 7 working days of confirmation. 
        Try to keep that item in original packing and condition. <br>
        <br>
        We will examine the garments, returned by you and we will try to figure out what went
        wrong and take immediate steps to prevent such problems from re-occurring. <br>
        <br>
        As we believe in safe delivery, likewise sending back the item to us carefully is 
        your responsibility as well. For any further shipping related queries mail us at <a href="mailto:shipping@sareez.com"><font color="maroon">shipping@sareez.com</font></a>. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Color and Description Disclaimer</b> <br>
        A customer must fix an order keeping in mind some minor variation in color, 
        as seen on a computer screen against the actual color of the outfit received. 
        It seems bit tough for us to replicate the same color as seen on a monitor. Although extra
        attention is given to accurately reproduce colors, still there
        may be minor variations 
        in color of the actual product due to the nature of fabric dyes. A variation in shade is 
        considered as a normal practice as these garments have a tendency to reflect different 
        shades of color under different lights. <br>
        <br>
        The customers who are preferring items with beaded embroidery and sequins must 
        be aware of the fact that these shiny embellishments have a tendency to come off. 
        Remember even with the best of handling and care, this problem cannot be avoided altogether. 
        So, before ordering such item please keeps these things in mind. We are at your service
        and it is our Endeavour to provide you best sarees,salwar kameej,lehengas, which are in 
        fashion. It is a privilege for having you as our customer! <br>
