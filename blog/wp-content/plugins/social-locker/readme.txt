The Social Locker locks your most valuable site content behind a set of social buttons until the visitor likes, shares, +1s or tweets your page. It helps to improve social performance of your website, get more likes/shares, build quality followers and attract more traffic from social networks.

<strong>Do you still place social buttons on every page of your website? But visitors don’t like/share your content as often as you would like?</strong>

You should **give people a reason** why they need to click your social buttons. Even if people like your content, 
site or fanpage, they don’t click the buttons because they don’t worry about you, your benefits or your traffic. 
It’s not their problem.

But ask people to “pay” with a Like/Tweet/+1 to get access to your content, to get a discount, to download, to read an ending of your article, to watch a video or to view a funny picture. And it will start to work as it should be!

With Social Locker, you can lock anything in your content and automatically unlock it after a visitor has shared your page. All you need to do is select the part of your content you want to lock, click a button and you’re done!
