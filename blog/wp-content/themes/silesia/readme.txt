IMPORTANT
Silesia theme comes with built-in shortcodes. Shortcodes are a very easy way to display lot of things on your blog posts and sidebars by inserting a very simple code like this: [yellow]very simple[/yellow] 
There is, however, ONE limitation that does apply. When the theme is changed, the shortcode output is replaced with shortcode markup and will not be rendered properly. To resolve the limitation you should download and install NattyWP Shortcodes plugin:
