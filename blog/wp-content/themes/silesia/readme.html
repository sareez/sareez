<h1>Installation</h1>
<ul>
<li>1.	<strong>Primary:</strong> Login to your wp-admin area and go to Appearance -> Themes. Select Install tab and click on Upload link. Select theme .zip and ckick on Install now button. If you have any errors, use alternate method.</li>
<li>2.	<strong>Alternate:</strong> Unzip the template file (silesia.zip) that you have downloaded. Via FTP, upload the whole folder (Silesia) to your server and place it in the /wp-content/themes/ folder. Do not change directory name. The template files should thus be here now: /wp-content/themes/silesia/index.php (for example).</li>
<li>3.	Log into your WP admin panel and click on the Design tab. Now click on the Silesia theme to activate it.</li>
<li>4.	Complete all of the required inputs on the Silesia Options page (in the WP admin panel) and click "Save Changes".</li>
<li>5. Read our <a href="http://support.nattywp.com/">Knowlegebase</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>How to upload Header?</h1>
<p>You can open Custom Header section. Go to Appearance -> Header and use Upload Image tool.</p>


<h1>Note</h1>
<p>The preferred screen resolution for viewing Silesia theme is 1090 x 768. It does not fit the screen in 1024 x 768</p>

<h1>IMPORTANT</h1>
<p>Silesia theme comes with built-in shortcodes. Shortcodes are a very easy way to display lot of things on your blog posts and sidebars by inserting a very simple code like this: <strong>[yellow]very simple[/yellow]</strong></p>
<p>There is, however, ONE limitation that does apply. When the theme is changed, the shortcode output is replaced with shortcode markup and will not be rendered properly. To resolve the limitation you should download and install NattyWP Shortcodes plugin:
